## Recall iterables

Let's recall the topic about iterables. 

The idea is that we have an object, such as `range` here:
```js
let range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5
};
```

...And we'd like to use `for..of` loop on it, such as `for(value of range)`, to get values from `1` to `5`.

In other words, we want to add an *iteration ability* to the object.

That can be implemented using a special method with the name `Symbol.iterator`:

- This method is called in by the `for..of` construct when the loop is started, and **it should return an object** with the `next` method.
- For each iteration, the `next()` method is invoked for the next value.
- The `next()` should return a value in the form `{done: true/false, value:<loop value>}`, where `done:true` means the end of the loop.
